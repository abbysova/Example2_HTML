# Example2_HTML
The goal of this project was to create a web page that has a form with a text box and two buttons: Add and Remove Last. 
When the Add button is clicked, whatever text the user has entered in the form should be added to a list after the form &amp; buttons. 
When the Remove Last button is clicked, the last list item should be removed from the list. 
The link to the webpage is: http://students.css.edu/asova/Assignment2.html
